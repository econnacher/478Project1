/*
* FIRST BAREBONES IMPLEMENTATION OF A SENDER STATION
* Essentially, the way this mechanism works is that the station
* keeps track of what state it currently is, as well as when does the next state (called stages in the code) occurs.
* 
* So the way the mechanism works is, the station keeps track of its current state in the 'status' variable.
* Whenever a packet arrives or status changes, it changes states and updates when will the pstation to something next
* In 'main', main will look at when the next event is for all packets, and basically move forward in time to that event
* 
* For example, let's say we are in the 'wait' period, and a packet arrives to the station
* The station will start DIFS and set status = DIFS
* Then, it will update its nextStageTime timer to what the current Time is + DIFS time
* at that point, it is meant to end DIFS and move on to the next stage.
* 
* So whenever it refreshes, it checks "hey, is the current time the time I go on to the next stage? (currentTime == nextStageTime)
* If it is, it knows its current state has ended, and moves on to the next stage
* 
* The way main figures when the next event for a station is, is with the getNextEvent method. (check out main). 
* We basically choose our next refresh to happen either when we change states, or when a packet arrives
* (we keep them as separate variables for reasons I can discuss in-person).
* 
* Most of the logic happens in the refresh method. For now, I have it return an int which refers to the channel usage
* If the function returns 0, then it has not added any packets to the channel.
* If it returns 1, it has tarted occupying the channel
* If it returns -1, it has stopped occupying a channel
*
